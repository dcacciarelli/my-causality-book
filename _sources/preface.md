# Preface

This work-in-progress book is designed to provide comprehensive tutorials on causal inference methodologies. This book explains key concepts in this rapidly growing research area and showcases potential applications within electricity markets. 


**Prerequisites**

To get the most out of this book, it is recommended that readers have a basic understanding of:
- **Statistics and probability**: familiarity with basic statistical concepts and probability theory.
- **Python programming**: basic knowledge of Python and possibly experience with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, and scikit-learn.
- **Machine learning**: an understanding of linear regression models, and an overview of machine learning concepts.

If you feel like you need a refresher, at the beginning of this book you can find a **crash course** to review these essential concepts. These chapters are designed to help you brush up on the foundational knowledge required to fully engage with the material in this book. However, if you are already familiar with these concepts or prefer to go directly to the applied causal inference part, feel free to skip those chapters.


**Learning objectives**

By the end of this book, readers will be able to:
- Understand and apply causal inference techniques to analyse relationships between variables.
- Use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to represent and reason about causal structures.
- Implement and interpret various causal discovery algorithms.
- Estimate causal effects using methods like instrumental variables, double machine learning, and difference-in-differences.
- Interpret results from complex machine learning models.
- Design experiments to gather data that supports causal analysis.

:class: note

The examples are provided in **Python**:
- Each chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible, enabling you to focus on specific topics without needing prior chapters.
- Chapters can be run independently, allowing you to generate data and apply statistical methods on their own.
- Each chapter is available for download as a **Jupyter Notebook**, facilitating hands-on learning and enabling you to reproduce the results effortlessly.
