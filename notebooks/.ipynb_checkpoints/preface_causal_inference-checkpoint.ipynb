    "Causal inference focuses on estimating the strength and nature of identified causal relationships. This part uses statistical techniques to quantify the effect of one variable on another, given that the causal structure is known or assumed. It aims to provide precise and reliable estimates of causal effects, essential for making informed decisions and predictions."
