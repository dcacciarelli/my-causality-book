    "A **random variable** is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics. It represents a variable whose values are determined by the outcomes of a random phenomenon. A **discrete random variable** takes on a countable number of distinct values, while a **continuous random variable** can take any value within an interval on the real number line. Random variables are characterized by their probability distribution, which specifies the probabilities that the variable takes on each of its possible values. The key characteristics of a probability distribution are their expected value (mean) and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random process** (or stochastic process) is a collection of random variables indexed by time or another variable, used to model systems that evolve randomly over time or space. A random process is a function that assigns a random variable to each point in a time or space domain (examples include stock market prices, weather patterns, and noise signals in electrical engineering). We can distinguish between discrete-time processes (whose indices are countable), and continuous-time processes (whose indices are an interval). We can also distinguish between stationary processes (whose statistical properties are constant over time), and nonstationary processes. A Markov process is a special type of stochastic process where the future state depends only on the current state.\n",

Mathematically, two random variables $X$ and $Y$ are marginally independent ($X \\perp Y$) if their joint probability distribution can be expressed as the product of their marginal probability\n",

In practice, what we are doing is splitting the entire probability space into parts based on the values of $Y$, calculating the expected value of $X$ (this is $\\mathbb{E}[X|Y]$), and then taking the expectation of these conditional expectations over the distribution of $Y$. Imagine $Y$ as categorizing or segmenting the probability space into different scenarios or groups. Within each group, you calculate the average value of $X$ (this gives you $\\mathbb{E}[X|Y=y]$ for each $y$). Then, you average these averages over all possible groups (weighted by the probability of each group $Y=y$, leading back to the overall average of $X$.

    "The **i.i.d. assumption** is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics, with significant implications. Independence implies that the occurrence of one event or the value of one variable does not influence the occurrence of another. In the context of random variables, $X_1, X_2 \\ldots, X_n$ being independent means the outcome of $X_i$ provides no information about the outcome of $X_j$, $i\\neq j$. Identically distributed means that each of the random variables has the same probability distribution. They do not need to take on the same value, but the rules governing their behavior (i.e., the likelihood of each outcome) are identical. In the context of supervised learning, the i.i.d. assumption assumes that the training and test data are independently drawn from the same underlying probability distribution. This enables the use of statistical tools and techniques, such as maximum likelihood estimation and hypothesis testing, which are based on the assumption of independent and identically distributed data. In real-world data, this assumption is often violated as data may be dependent and non-identically distributed due to distribution shifts across geography or time, sampling practices, or the presence of confounding variables and selection bias.\n",

This is particularly useful in practical scenarios such as statistical sampling and hypothesis testing, where it is often necessary to make inferences about population parameters. The intuition of the CLT is that as we increase the number of random variables in our sample, the peculiarities and individual randomness of each variable tend to cancel out. This leads to the emergence of the normal distribution, which is symmetric and centered around the mean. The CLT is powerful because it applies to a wide range of distributions, whether they are symmetric, skewed, or even arbitrary, as long as the variables are i.i.d. with a finite variance.\n",

A key property of an estimator is consistency, which means that $\\hat{\\theta}_n$ converges to $\\theta$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$. An estimator that fails to be consistent is generally not desirable. Another important aspect is the bias of an estimator, defined as $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\theta}_n - \\theta]$. An estimator is unbiased if its bias is zero for all $\\theta$. The estimator also has a variance, denoted as $\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\theta}]$.

    "## Hypothesis testing framework\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a fundamental framework in statistics used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a certain condition holds for the entire population. In hypothesis testing, two contradictory hypotheses about a population parameter are considered: the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_1$). The null hypothesis represents a default position or a statement of no effect or no difference. The alternative hypothesis represents what we want to prove or establish. A test statistic is calculated from the sample data and is used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. The choice of test statistic depends on the nature of the data and the hypothesis being tested. The P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the observed value under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A smaller P-value indicates that the observed data is less likely under the null hypothesis. Based on the P-value and a predetermined significance level (usually denoted as $\\alpha$, commonly set at 0.05), a decision is made: if the P-value is less than $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis; if the P-value is greater than $\\alpha$, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur. Type I error corresponds to ejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (false positive). The probability of making a Type I error is $\\alpha$. Type II error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true (false negative). Hypothesis testing is a critical tool in statistics for making inferences about populations based on sample data. It allows researchers to test assumptions and make decisions based on statistical evidence. The goal of hypothesis testing is not to prove the null hypothesis but to assess the strength of evidence against it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a foundational concept in statistics used to infer the properties of a population based on sample data. The choice of distribution for conducting a hypothesis test depends on the nature of the data, the size of the sample, and the assumptions that can be made about the population. Below, we explore various hypothesis tests, the distributions used, and the rationale for their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparing means**\n",
    "- The **Z-test** is used when comparing the mean of a sample to a known population mean, or comparing the means of two large independent samples. The Z-test is applicable when the population variance is known and the sample size is large (typically $n > 30$). The normal distribution is used due to the CLT, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approximate a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **T-test** is used when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is small, the t-distribution is used. The t-test is more accommodating of the uncertainty in the sample estimate of the variance, providing more accurate confidence intervals and p-values. The t-distribution converges to the normal distribution as the sample size increases.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparing variances**: the **F-test** is used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and for comparing the variances of two samples. The F-distribution arises naturally when comparing the ratio of two variances, each of which follows a chi-squared distribution when the underlying population is normally distributed. The F-test assesses whether the groups have the same variance, an assumption often required in ANOVA and regression analysis. ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more samples. The F-distribution is used in ANOVA to compare the ratio of the variance explained by the model to the variance within the groups. This test helps to determine if there are significant differences between the means of the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Regression analysis**, the goal is to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Several tests can be employed:\n",
    "- \\textit{t-tests for regression coefficients:} To determine if individual predictors are significantly related to the dependent variable, t-tests are used, leveraging the t-distribution. This is because the estimates of the coefficients have distributions that are best modeled by the t-distribution, especially with small sample sizes.\n",
    "- \\textit{F-test for Overall Model Significance:} The F-test is used to assess whether at least one predictor variable has a non-zero coefficient, indicating that the model provides a better fit to the data than a model with no predictors.

The chi-squared distribution is used because the test statistic follows this distribution under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-parametric tests** can be used when the assumptions about the population distribution are not met.

    "## Bayesian learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical methods can be broadly divided into two macro-categories: frequentist and Bayesian. The frequentist approach views parameters as fixed but unknown quantities; uses data to estimate these parameters; and makes point estimates (i.e., a single best guess) for these parameters. The Bayesian approach views parameters as random variables; uses data and prior beliefs (prior distributions) to update our beliefs about these parameters; and results in a probability distribution over the parameters, capturing the uncertainty. Another difference is that Bayesian statistics treats probability as a measure of belief or certainty rather than frequency. This means probabilities are subjective and can be updated as new information becomes available. In frequentist statistics, probability is interpreted as the long-run frequency of events. It relies on the concept of an infinite sequence of repeated trials. Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs through the use of prior probability distributions, while in frequentist methods all inferences are made solely from the data at hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian approach is formalized using Bayes' theorem:\n",

    "where: \n",
    "- $P(\\theta | X)$ is the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data.\n",
    "- $P(X | \\theta)$ is the likelihood of the data given the parameters. It represents the probability of observing the data $X$ given a particular set of parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "- $P(\\theta)$ is the prior distribution of the parameters (our beliefs before seeing the data).\n",
    "- $P(X)$ is the evidence or marginal likelihood. It is the probability of the data over all possible parameter values, which acts as a normalizing constant to ensure the posterior distribution sums (or integrates) to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our initial beliefs or probabilities $P(\\theta)$ in light of new evidence ($X$). In other words, it provides a way to revise existing predictions or hypotheses given new or additional information. Computing the posterior distribution means determining the probability distribution of the parameters of a model given the observed data. In a Bayesian context, this means updating our beliefs about possible parameter values based on the evidence provided by the data. When we say ``computing the posterior distribution'', we are essentially trying to determine $P(\\theta | X)$ for all possible values of $\\theta$. The main challenge in Bayesian learning is computing the posterior distribution, especially for complex models. This is where methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) come into play. Because of these challenges, we often resort to methods like sampling (e.g., MCMC) or approximations to estimate the posterior distribution, rather than computing it exactly. The goal is to get a representation of the distribution that lets us make informed decisions about the likely values of the parameters given the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the posterior distribution is the core of Bayesian inference. After observing data, we combine our prior beliefs with the likelihood of the observed data to compute the posterior distribution. The shape of this distribution reflects our updated beliefs about the parameters given the data. Once we have the posterior distribution, we can draw samples from it. Each sample represents a plausible value of the parameter(s) given our prior beliefs and the observed data. By looking at the spread and distribution of these samples, we can understand the uncertainty associated with our estimates. In many situations, especially with complex models, the posterior distribution might not have a simple analytical form. In these cases, we cannot just ``look'' at the posterior directly. Instead, we use sampling techniques (like MCMC methods) to draw samples from the posterior, even if we cannot describe the posterior in a simple equation. These samples then serve multiple purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uncertainty estimation: The spread and distribution of the samples give a sense of how uncertain we are about our parameter estimates.\n",
    "- Predictive modeling: We can use the samples to make predictions for new data and to get a sense of uncertainty in those predictions.\n",
    "- Model checking: We can compare the predictions of our model (using the posterior samples) to the actual observed data to see if our model is a good fit.\n",
    "- Decision making: In practical scenarios, decisions might be based on the posterior samples, especially when we need to consider the uncertainty in our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in summary, while the posterior distribution encapsulates our updated beliefs after seeing data, sampling from the posterior allows us to quantify, explore, and make decisions based on the uncertainty in those beliefs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC algorithms are used to approximate complex probability distributions. They are especially useful in Bayesian statistics when direct computation of the posterior distribution is challenging. The basic idea is that we want to understand a complex distribution, which is too intricate to tackle directly. Instead of trying to compute it exactly, we generate samples that come from that distribution. Over time, the distribution of these samples will closely match your target distribution. The key concepts of MCMC are two. A Markov chain is a sequence of random samples where each sample depends only on the one before it. It is like a random walk where each step is influenced only by the current position. Monte Carlo is a technique where we use random sampling to get numerical results for problems that might be deterministic in principle. The name originates from the Monte Carlo Casino, as it relies on randomness. The main steps of MCMC algorithms are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialization: Start at a random position (a random parameter value).\n",
    "- Proposal: At each step, propose a new position based on the current one. This can be a random jump, but it is typically a small move.\n",
    "- Acceptance: Decide whether to move to the proposed position. If the new position is a better fit to the data (higher posterior probability*), we will likely accept it. If it is worse, you might still accept it but with a lower probability. This decision process ensures you explore the whole space but spend more time in high-probability areas.\n",
    "- Iteration: Repeat the proposal and acceptance steps many times. The more steps, the better your approximation will be.\n",
    "- Burn-In: The initial samples might not be representative because the chain might start far from a high-probability area. So, we will discard an initial set of samples, a process called ``burn-in''.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we determine if the posterior distribution is higher if we do not have an analytical form? This is the key idea behind MCMC methods (like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm). We do not need to know the exact value of the posterior distribution; we only need to know it up to a constant of proportionality. In many cases, while the full posterior is hard to compute (due to the difficulty in calculating the normalization constant), its unnormalized version is computable. Remember the basic Bayes' formula\n",

    "In many applications, we can compute the product of the likelihood and the prior for any given set of parameters, but we might not be able to easily normalize it to get a true probability distribution. So, when deciding whether to accept a new proposed position in MCMC, we first compute the unnormalized posterior at the current position (which is the product of the likelihood and the prior). Then we compute the unnormalized posterior at the proposed new position. Finally, we compare these values. If the unnormalized posterior is higher at the new position, then it means the true posterior is also higher there.\n",
    "Even if we cannot say exactly what the posterior value is at that position, we can still determine if it is higher or lower than at the current position. This relative comparison, rather than an absolute value, is what drives the decision to accept or reject the new proposed position. For the case where the proposed position has a lower unnormalized posterior value, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm provides a rule to accept it with a probability proportional to the ratio of the unnormalized posteriors (proposed to current). This ensures exploration of the entire parameter space, preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in local modes. In essence, MCMC is a systematic way to ``wander around'' in a parameter space to understand a probability distribution, especially when direct computation is difficult or impossible. Why MCMC methods are useful:\n",
    "\n",

    "- Complex models: Many models (especially in Bayesian settings) result in posterior distributions that are hard to describe and compute. MCMC provides an approach to explore these distributions without needing an analytical solution.\n",
