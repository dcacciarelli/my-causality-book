It differentiates between correlation and causation, introduces causal graphs, and explains basic causal structures. A comprehensive glossary is also provided to clarify key definitions and terminology. These fundamental concepts are crucial for grasping the more advanced topics covered later in the book.\n",

This involves uncovering the underlying causal structure without assuming prior knowledge of the direction or nature of causality. It typically uses statistical and computational methods to determine which variables influence which other variables.\n",

This process uncovers the underlying causal structure without assuming prior knowledge of the direction or nature of causality.

    "\n",
    "Causal inference focuses on estimating the strength and nature of identified causal relationships. This part uses statistical techniques to quantify the effect of one variable on another, given that the causal structure is known or assumed. It aims to provide precise and reliable estimates of causal effects, essential for making informed decisions and predictions.\n",

    "## Interpretability\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability is crucial for understanding and explaining how models make predictions or decisions. This section introduces techniques that offer insights into the importance of different features, the effect of individual variables, and the overall behaviour of the model. These methods enhance transparency and trust in the models used in electricity markets.\n",

    "## Designs\n",
    "\n",
    "Designs refer to the structured and methodical approach to planning, conducting, analysing, and interpreting controlled experiments. This part covers techniques for setting up experiments to ensure that the results are valid, reliable, and can be used to draw causal conclusions. Effective experimental design is key to deriving actionable insights and making evidence-based decisions.\n",
