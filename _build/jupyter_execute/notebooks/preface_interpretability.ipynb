    "Interpretability is crucial for understanding and explaining how models make predictions or decisions. This section introduces techniques that offer insights into the importance of different features, the effect of individual variables, and the overall behaviour of the model. These methods enhance transparency and trust in the models used in electricity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and interpreting the inner workings of machine learning models is essential for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transparency**: clear insights into how a model makes decisions help build trust among stakeholders, including regulators, operators, and consumers.\n",
    "- **Accountability**: interpretability allows for better scrutiny and ensures that the model's decisions can be explained and justified, which is particularly important in regulated industries like electricity markets.\n",
    "- **Debugging and improvement**: by understanding which features influence the model's predictions, data scientists and engineers can identify and correct issues, improving the model's accuracy and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite providing some transparency, **these methods alone do not have causal guarantees** as they merely indicate how the predictions of the models are affected by changes in the covariates. Therefore, while they can show associations and effects within the model, they do not confirm causal relationships.\n",
