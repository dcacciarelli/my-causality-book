    "# Structural Causal Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural causal models (SCMs) are a powerful extension of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), providing a more detailed and quantitative framework for understanding causal relationships. While DAGs visually represent causal dependencies, SCMs use mathematical equations to specify how variables influence each other, capturing both direct and indirect effects. This allows us to precisely descibe data-generating processes and underlying relationships among variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components of SCMs\n",
    "SCMs are defined by a set of **structural equations**, where each endogenous variable is expressed as a function of its direct causes (parents) and an error term. These equations quantify the causal relationships depicted in a DAG. Within SCMs and DAGs, we can distinguish between endogenous and exogenous variables:\n",
    "- **Endogenous variables** are variables whose values are determined within the model. These are the nodes in the DAG.\n",
    "- **Exogenous Variables** are variables that affect the endogenous variables but are not influenced by them. These are typically represented as error terms in the structural equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **error terms** capture the influence of unobserved factors on each endogenous variable. They represent all other influences not explicitly included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## From DAG to SCM\n",
    "DAGs and SCMs are closely related:\n",
    "- **From DAG to SCM:** each directed edge in a DAG corresponds to a term in a structural equation. The absence of an edge implies no direct causal effect.\n",
    "- **From SCM to DAG:** structural equations can be translated into a DAG by drawing an edge from each parent variable to its child variable as specified by the equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Let's now see in practice how we can translate a DAG into a SCM, that will give us the structural equations we can use to generate data following the causal structure represented by the DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Drawing a Simple DAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a simple DAG represenitng the effect of weather fluctuations on wind forecast errors and balancing costs. In electricity markets, balancing costs are the expenses incurred to maintain the balance between electricity supply and demand. Balancing is crucial for the stability of the electricity grid. Balancing costs arise when there is a need to match the electricity supply with the actual demand in real time. If the wind forecast is inaccurate, the grid operator may need to use more expensive and less efficient sources of electricity to make up for the shortfall or to reduce excess supply. This incurs additional costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect the following relationship between these three variables:\n",
    "- **Weather conditions** are exogenous variables, which are driven by external factors such as climate patterns, geographical location, and seasonal changes.\n",
    "- **Weather fluctuations directly influence wind forecast errors**. For example, unexpected weather changes can lead to larger errors in predicting wind energy production.\n",
    "- **Wind forecast errors directly influence balancing costs**. Larger forecast errors typically result in higher balancing costs due to the need for additional adjustments in electricity supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These relationships translate into the following DAG."
