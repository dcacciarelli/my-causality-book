:class: tip

This book is highly applied, aimed at providing essential intuitions and practical examples on applying causal inference methods to real-world problems. We currently focus primarily on semi-parametric approaches, inspired by the methodologies presented in [Statistical Causal Discovery: LiNGAM Approach](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-4-431-55784-5). The examples are implemented using the LiNGAM Python package {cite}`ikeuchi2023python`.

For additional theoretical and technical explanations, we suggest:
