# Electricity Markets

<br>


Electricity markets are multifaceted and dynamic systems that are critical for balancing the supply and demand of electricity in real time {cite}`bunn2004modelling`. Over the past few decades, these markets have undergone significant transformations, evolving from vertically integrated monopolies to competitive environments. This evolution has introduced new challenges, such as managing the diverse interests of stakeholders, addressing the complex interactions between economic and physical systems, and adapting to the fluctuating nature of energy production and consumption {cite}`kirschen2018fundamentals`.

The electricity market is typically divided into two main segments: wholesale and retail. Wholesale markets deal with bulk transactions between generators and suppliers, while retail markets cater to end consumers. These markets are intricately linked to the national grid and subject to regulatory frameworks, all of which contribute to their complexity.


## Key Actors

The electricity market ecosystem involves various key participants, each playing a critical role in ensuring the smooth operation of electricity generation, transmission, and consumption. The primary actors include:

- **Generators**: entities responsible for producing electricity. This can be done through various energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable sources like wind, solar, and biomass.
- **Transmission operators**: these operators manage the high-voltage transmission networks, ensuring the efficient long-distance transport of electricity. They are responsible for the stability and reliability of the grid infrastructure.
- **System operators**: these entities are responsible for overseeing the real-time operation of the electricity grid. They balance supply and demand, manage system stability, and ensure that the electricity network operates smoothly across various regions. They also facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources and manage ancillary services to maintain grid reliability.
- **Retailers**: energy suppliers that purchase electricity from the wholesale market and sell it to end consumers. Retailers are also responsible for billing, customer service, and regulatory compliance.
- **Consumers**: end-users of electricity, ranging from households to large industrial facilities. Consumer demand is a key factor in determining the pricing and operational strategies in the market.
